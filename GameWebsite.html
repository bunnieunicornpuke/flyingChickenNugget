                    <p class="mb-0">"Magicorns,  a strategy game where it’s like Flappy Bird,  but it’s not :),  because it’s magical.  We have unicorns and magic,  and they have plumbings."</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">“Unicorns and some clouds.  Designed to look and act like the classic Flappy Bird,  but with a twist :).  Also includes rules.”</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">“Unicorns,  clouds,  food,  and magic for all!”</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">“Playing as a unicorn,  players have fun worrying about not crashing into clouds or out of the screen.  Enjoy deciding the idea of what power ups to pick up (by the way,  some aren’t power ups,  but whatever floats your boat,  right?).  Yeah…  you get the idea.”</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">“Let your panic run wild as happy unicorns and bland clouds take place in this magical world.  Confliction ensues.”</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">“Try to steer your unicorn away from obstacles and fly IN BETWEEN (not through) clouds (unless you want to die a miserable death,  then be my guest).  Repeat for 3.36 hours.  Enjoy.”</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">“Soar high in the sky and kiss your worries good-bye.  Fly through clouds?  Not in this game!  ‘Cause if you do,  you die.”</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">“You play as a happy,  pappy,  unicorn named,  ‘Daddy’.  In this magic packed game,  you have not two,  not three,  and certainly not nine,  but ONE CHANCE to get through the clouds…  or die.  To NOT DIE,  you avoid the clouds.  Simple,  right?  WRONG.  Wake up call,  when life gets easier and easier,  it becomes a lot tougher.  In this game,  it teaches us that.  Because if you’re going to think that life is all fun and games,  you might as well learn the cold,  hard truth in a game,  right?  We’re doing you a favour,  because you might think that life is going swell (oHh My LiFe iS sO pErFeCt,  i DoN’t WaNt iT tO cHaNgE),  but then something happens that affects you and changes that.  We teach you to SUCK IT UP.  But anyway,  as your score increases,  the game gets harder and harder.  Get ready for random objects hitting you,  or the things that you’ll be REQUIRED to collect.  Happy flying!”</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">“Planning on playing the classical game,  Flappy Bird?  HAHA,  you funny.  Not today,  🅱!  Instead,  you have no other choice but to play THIS GAME!  Magicorns!  Unlike Flappy Bird,  we don’t just flapper thy wings,  wE fLaPpEr ThY hArTs.  Enjoy.”</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">“The game is really addictive,  because it’s infuriating.  Infuriating things motivate you in a way.  They make you determined to succeed.”</p>
